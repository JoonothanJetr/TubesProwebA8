# Product Modal Performance Optimization

## Summary of Changes

We've optimized the product modal loading performance with several key improvements:

1. **Enhanced Caching Mechanism**
   - Implemented request deduplication to prevent duplicate API requests
   - Added cache validation timestamps
   - Added global prefetching for popular products

2. **Optimized Image Components**
   - Created `ImageWithFallbackOptimized` with better loading state handling
   - Added `ProductImageOptimized` with proper memoization
   - Improved image URL handling with efficient caching

3. **Reduced UI Re-renders**
   - Used `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks to avoid unnecessary re-renders
   - Memoized expensive UI calculations
   - Improved modal state management

4. **Prefetching Strategy**
   - Added hover-based prefetching for product details
   - Implemented intelligent prefetching for visible products
   - Created a dedicated prefetch helper utility

5. **API Optimization**
   - Enhanced API error handling
   - Added proper caching in the product service
   - Implemented parallel loading with concurrency limits

## How to Test These Improvements

1. Navigate to the products page
2. Hover over a product card (this triggers prefetching)
3. Click to view product details - the modal should now load immediately
4. Close and reopen the same product - it should be instant

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Backend Improvements**
   - Consider implementing a dedicated endpoint for product summaries vs details
   - Add a Redis cache layer for frequently accessed products

2. **Frontend Optimizations**
   - Implement React Query for improved data fetching and caching
   - Consider code splitting for lazy-loading modals
   - Add progressive image loading with low-quality previews

3. **Image Delivery Optimizations**
   - Use modern image formats (WebP, AVIF) with browser fallbacks
   - Implement proper responsive images for different screen sizes
   - Consider a CDN for image delivery

By implementing these optimizations, the product modal should now load much faster, especially for products that have been previously viewed or prefetched through hovering.
